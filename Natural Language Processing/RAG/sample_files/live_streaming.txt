Live streaming apps employ a distributed architecture for real-time content delivery. The architecture consists of: 1. **Capture/Encoder**: Initiates content capture, converting it into a digital format suitable for streaming. Common terms include encoding (H.264, H.265), adaptive bitrate streaming, and capture devices like webcams. 2. **Streaming Server**: Manages content distribution, utilizing protocols such as RTMP or HLS. This component handles tasks like transcoding, load balancing, and securing content through encryption (HTTPS). 3. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Replicates and distributes content across multiple servers globally, ensuring low latency and high availability. CDNs enhance scalability and reduce the load on the streaming server. 4. **Player/Client**: Renders the streamed content on user devices. Concepts like buffering, latency optimization, and adaptive streaming (DASH, HLS) are crucial for a smooth viewing experience. By seamlessly integrating these components, live streaming apps achieve real-time content delivery, enabling users to engage with events as they unfold. Technologies like Wowza, OBS Studio, and Akamai play integral roles in shaping the architecture of live streaming applications.
